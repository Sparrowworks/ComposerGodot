<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Usage</strong></summary>

## üî® Scene Handling

+ To add/replace/restart a scene, simply call:
```
Composer.load_scene("path_to_scene", {"data_to_transfer": "Hello world!", "level": 1})
```
+ The first argument takes the path to the scene you'd like to create. The second argument is for passing any data with a Dictionary and is optional.

## üèóÔ∏è Loading Screens
**Adding a custom loading screen**
+ To add a Loading Screen, call the 
```
Composer.setup_load_screen("path_to_load_screen")
```
This will add a loading screen and allows you to play any animations you'd like before actual loading (e.g. fade-in transition).
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! You can only have one active Loading Screen at a time.

**Removing a loading screen**
+ To completely remove a Loading Screen, call
```
Composer.clear_load_screen()
```
